## How to run the code
You can start the dbms by running dbms.py file in the /src/ directory. Once you have the dependencies installed (see here), run the program like so:

Additionally, the dbms has been tested using the PA1 test script. The test script can be run through the dmbs like so:

    python src/dbms.py < tests/pa1_test.txt

- csv - for file creation/deletion/manipulation
- re - for parsing SQL statements
- os - for directory creation/deletion as well as file/directory existance checking
